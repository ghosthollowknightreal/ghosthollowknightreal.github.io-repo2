<h1 style="color: #182D09; font-weight: bold; font-size: 200%;"> Hello, my name is Bobby, and today im providing information on my pet rock.</h1> <br>
<br> 
<big style="color: #182D09; font-weight: bold; font-size: 200%;"> My pet rock is sedimentary, as it has many bands in it, This is caused by layers of sediment piling up and compacting together.</big> <br>
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p style="font-size: 50px; color: #182D09; font-weight: bold;"> But what does the rock look like? </p>
 <img align="right" src="unnamed (1).jpg" width="750" height="750" alt="My rock." /> <p style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; color: #182D09"> This rock is grey, crossing out it possibly being obsidian, and it is also not igneous. <br>
  <br>
  This rock is clearly sedimentary, as it has bands formed of many different types of sediments, and fits many other characteristics of sedimentary rocks. </p> <br>
 <br>
 <p style="font-size: 75px; color: #182D09; font-weight: bold;"> But where did I find this? </p> <br>
 <br>
 <p style="font-size: 50px; color: #182D09; font-weight: bold;"> I found this rock at the end of my street, forest park drive. I found this on wednesday, or 5/7/25. </p><br>
 <br>
 <p style="font-size: 50px; color: #182D09; font-weight: bold;"> This rock was most likely formed by sediments in a river piling up and compressing, where the river would eventually dry up, leaving rocks behind, or alternatively, they may have been moved to aid in construction. </p> <br>
 <br>
 <p style="font-size: 50px; color: #182D09; font-weight: bold;"> Although this rock is suitable to become igneous, it is unlikely that it will, as theres not any volcanos or high heat holes in the earth for it to fall into and melt in. <br>
 <br>
 This rock is also able to become metamorphic, and is more likely than it becoming igneous, as after a few thousand years, it may be absorbed into the ground enough to be stretched out like slime but not melt like ice. </p>
 <img align="left" src="unnamed (1).jpg" width="750" height="750" alt="A second POV of my rock." /> <p style="font-size: 50px; color: #182D09; font-weight: bold;"> This is a second point of view of my rock. It helps in analysis, and determining how it formed. <br>
                                                                                                     <br>
                                                                                                     This rock is sedimentary due to the many types of sediments causing bands in it. It most likely came from a river long dried up. <br>
  <br>
  But to be specific, this likely formed from the Cuyahoga river, as it is the only river that could sensibly create a rock this big, while still crossing north ridgeville. <br>
  <br>
  This seems to have a mineral composition of around 3 minerals, as its bands seem to be similar looking, indicating that they are made of the same few minerals/sediment. It has a sandy texture, (besides the fact, you know, it doesnt crumble in your hand)<br>
  <br>
  Its grain seems to vary from place to place, as it is constructed of a few sediments and minerals, making it hard to pinpoint its exact grain pattern, but its shape seems to be mostly random, not holding any form of pattern. </p>
