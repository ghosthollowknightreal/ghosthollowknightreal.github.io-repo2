<h1 style="color: #182D09; font-weight: bold; font-size: 200%;"> Hello, my name is Bobby, and today im providing information on my pet rock.</h1> <br>
<br> 
<big style="color: #182D09; font-weight: bold; font-size: 200%;"> My pet rock is sedimentary, as it has many bands in it, This is caused by layers of sediment piling up and compacting together.</big> <br>
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p style="font-size: 50px; color: #182D09; font-weight: bold;"> But what does the rock look like? </p>
 <img align="right" src="unnamed (1).jpg" width="750" height="750" alt="My rock." /> <p style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; color: #182D09"> This rock is grey, crossing out it possibly being obsidian, and it is also not igneous. <br>
  <br>
  This rock is clearly sedimentary, as it has bands formed of many different types of sediments, and fits many other characteristics of sedimentary rocks. </p> <br>
 <br>
 <p style="font-size: 75px; color: #182D09; font-weight: bold;"> But where did I find this? </p> <br>
 <br>
 <p style="font-size: 50px; color: #182D09; font-weight: bold;"> I found this rock at the end of my street, forest park drive. I found this on wednesday, or 5/7/25. </p><br>
 <br>
 <p style="font-size: 50px; color: #182D09; font-weight: bold;"> This rock was most likely formed by sediments in a river piling up and compressing, where the river would eventually dry up, leaving rocks behind, or alternatively, they may have been moved to aid in construction. </p> <br>
 <br>
 <p style="font-size: 50px; color: #182D09; font-weight: bold;"> Although this rock is suitable to become igneous, it is unlikely that it will, as theres not any volcanos or high heat holes in the earth for it to fall into and melt in. <br>
 <br>
 This rock is also able to become metamorphic, and is more likely than it becoming igneous, as after a few thousand years, it may be absorbed into the ground enough to be stretched out like slime but not melt like ice. </p>
